Physics-Informed Neural Networks in CFD applications
# Physics-Informed Neural Networks Toolkit

A comprehensive toolkit for applying Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to Computational Fluid Dynamics problems.

Overview:

This project combines mesh generation, CFD simulation, and machine learning tools to create an integrated workflow for PINNs research. Started as personal research into PINNs applications in fluid dynamics.

Features:

- Automated mesh generation using SALOME
- Mesh format conversion and training point extraction
- OpenFOAM case automation for reference data
- PINN implementation with PyTorch
- Material properties integration
- Mock modes for development without full dependencies
